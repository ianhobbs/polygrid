This is my first grid solution called polygrid.
This is now depreciated and maintained for legacy projects.

This remains as a implementation of modular scale.

Much of the modualr scale work is better implemented in 
https://utopia.fyi/

Whats good about Utopia? Implementing css --vars integrates well with js injection.

Utopia is missing a grid though so expect a merge of this Utopia's of implementaion of modular scale with
some bits of this grid in a related repo. Polygrid-6
